### Graduate Student at UW-Madison

I am currently a second year graduate student in the Computer Sciences department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My primary research interest is in the field of human-robot interaction, predominantly the social aspect of it, and integrating robotic technologies into human activities and settings. In particular, I am interested in long-term companion robot engagement and deployments, as well as their integration within family and school environments.


### Previously @Van Robotics
In my prior life working in the industry, I spent several years at Van as the Lead Software Architect, building and developing awesome software and infrastructure to support ABii, a highly personalized educational robot. With the ability to adapt to individual learning habits and encourage students to stay engaged, ABii aims to help students ultimately build confidence and core skills mastery.
