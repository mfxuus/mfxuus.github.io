I am a second year graduate student in the **CS department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison**. 

My primary research interest is in the field of human-robot interaction, predominantly the social aspect of it, and integrating robotic technologies into human activities and settings. In particular, I am interested in long-term companion robot engagement and deployments, as well as their integration within family and school environments.
